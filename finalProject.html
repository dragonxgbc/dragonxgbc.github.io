    <h1>Final Project Proposal: Project Flame</h1>
    <p>A tech demo, or proof of concept, showcasing the capabilities of a dynamic power-up model.</p>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>Project Flame is going to firstly be a tech demo showing how fire changes based on different periodic elements. 
        The demo will showcase the interaction between fire and its interactions with various elements, such as potassium, sodium, and strontium, 
        providing players with visual clarity and new abilities. Inspired by chemistry!

        I will be trying to use Godot to create a 2D platformer game/tech demo that will allow players to interact with fire and its elements.
        The tech demo will specifically focus on the progression of the <a href="https://imgur.com/yXUciHN" target="_blank">player character sprite</a> (see below).

    <h2>Project Updates</h2>
    <p>Updates will be posted here as the project progresses.</p>
    <h3>Week 1: Initial Setup</h3>
    <p>Set up the Godot project and created the initial player character sprite. Implemented basic movement mechanics. Getting to properly learn the ins and outs of Godot and GDScript,
      rather than using Unity and C#.</p>
    <h3>Week 2: Tileset & Environment Physics</h3> 
    <p>Found an open-source tileset for the game environment. The tileset is going to be used to build temporary levels before I land on a visual style. I figured it'd be insanely daunting to try to 
      create a tileset from scratch, so I found one that I can use in the meantime when I do figure out a style for the game.
    </p>
    <p>Implemented basic environment physics, including gravity and collision detection as well an interaction scene for the future, to allow the player to interact with objects I plan to implement in the following weeks.</p>
    <h3>Week 3: Firesprite Transformation</h3>
    <p>Working on the firesprite transformation mechanics, allowing the player character to absorb material objects from the environment and change its appearance accordingly. Monumental task due to the amount of spriting and animation involved.</p>
    <h3>Week 4: Finishing Touches</h3>
    <p>Polishing the game mechanics, respriting (oof), and game over reset.</p>

    <h2>Design Documentation</h2>
    <p>This document will serve as the primary design documentation for the project, detailing the various aspects of the game's design and development.</p>
