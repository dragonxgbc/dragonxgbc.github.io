    <h1>Final Project Proposal: Project Flame</h1>
    <p>A tech demo, or proof of concept, showcasing the capabilities of a dynamic power-up model.</p>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>Project Flame is going to firstly be a tech demo showing how fire changes based on different periodic elements. 
        The demo will showcase the interaction between fire and its interactions with various elements, such as phosphorus, 
        providing players with visual clarity and new abilities. Inspired by chemistry!

        I will be trying to use Godot to create a 2D game/tech demo that will allow players to interact with fire and its elements.
        The tech demo will specifically focus on the progression of the player character (a firesprite), with both linear and non-linear ways of progression.
