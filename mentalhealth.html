          <h3>Introduction: Two Artists, Two Centuries</h3>
          <p>
            The two artists I wanted to study in depth were Marcus Nelson, who is a multi-disciplinary artist based out of Berlin, and Vincent Van Gogh, an artist famously known for his vibrant, emotional art that featured a lot of bolder colors. I wanted to focus on both of these two artists, as Nelson focuses on men's mental health while Vincent Van Gogh struggled with his mental health. I wanted to see the differences and what was common between the two. I also wanted to compare the 21st century vs the 19th century, and how people coped with mental health and how similar the mechanisms were.

          <h3>Vincent Van Gogh: Crisis and Expression</h3>
          <p>
            Van Gogh's history with his mental health was tumultuous. His letters document his recurring episodes of depression, extreme agitation, and periods of psychological collapse. He lacked any stable diagnosis, and the medical systems of the late nineteenth century offered little to nothing in help, and would rather confine him. The most well-known incident is his act of self-harm in 1888, when he cut off his own ear due to psychological distress. This didn't happen in isolation; it was part of a larger pattern of instability that shaped his life and his work. His art became the only consistent method he had for processing those conditions. The common interpretation of his art is that due to the intensity of his brushwork and the volatility in his color choices, it mirrors the pressure he lived under.

          <h3>Marcus Nelson: Articulation and Contemporary Expression</h3>
          <p>
            Nelson, however, approaches mental health from a position of articulation rather than crisis. He examines men's emotional experience directly, using contemporary media to state feelings about mental health. Nelson works in a world with men's mental health, where it is still somewhat stigmatized due to public discourse and patriarchal structure. Van Gogh worked in a world without these discoveries, where his distress manifested through isolation and self-destructive behavior. Nelson's artwork is very abstract but it also shows that men also need a support system, which is a lacking commonality between a lot of men. And, when we do have those support systems, we unfortunately brush our feelings to the side with jokes, games and other things instead of addressing it and talking about it.

          <h3>Conclusion: Across Centuries</h3>
          <p>
            This contrast makes the comparison significant. Van Gogh's struggle becomes evidence of how little support existed for men in his period. Nelson's work shows how expression has shifted toward openness, analysis, and social engagement. Both reveal how men attempt to understand internal suffering, but the methods and consequences differ sharply across their centuries. It's especially shown in their artwork, where Nelson's artwork is somewhat of a theme of unity, while Van Gogh's is a vast expanse, showing how dark and grim your mind can become.
